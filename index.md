# Timeline JS
## What is Timeline?
Timeline is exactly what it says; it is a tool that can allow you to create a web timeline and include it on your website. It is created by Knightlab, and is located at [https://timeline.knightlab.com/].
## Making a Timeline
* After going to the Timeline website, select the ***Make a Timeline*** button. This navigates you to the step-by-step on using the website to make a timeline.
* First you need to ***Get the Spreadsheet Template***. You will be asked to ***Make a Copy*** of the Timeline template spreadsheet to your Google Drive.
* The template spreadsheet will automatically open. You now have the ability to fill in your information for your timeline. **DO NOT** Change any settings in row 1.
* Each row from 2 on will be a new slide in your timeline, if you need more, simply select *ADD (blank) more rows at bottom*.
* The columns across the top tell you what information to place: Beginning Year/Month/Time and Ending Year/Month/Date/Time (the ending date is optional). Headline is the title that will be shown for that particular row's slide, text is the body text that will be seen. Media is the column to include a link to a picture/video you would like to be shown on the timeline. Media credit gives credit to where the media came from, and media caption is the caption that will appear directly under the media (in smaller text then the body text).
## Previewing Your Timeline.
* After filling out your timeline spreadsheet, click on the ***File*** tab. From the dropdown menu, select ***publish to the web*** -> Embed -> ***Publish***. Close out of the pop-up window.
* copy the URL of your timeline, and paste it next to the ***Step 3*** on the timeline website in the ***Google Spreadsheet URL*** box.
* Next to ***Step 4*** on the timeline website, your personalized link and HTML for your timeline has been generated. Click on ***Preview*** to preview your timeline.
## Putting Your Timeline on Your Website
* After reviewing your document, copy the **Embed** code that was generated for you next to the ***Step 4***.
* Go to your website's admin/edit page. Select the page you wish your timeline to be on.
* Make sure that HTML for your page is on, (there may be an 'HTML editor' button for this). Paste your embedded HTML code, and save the changes to page.
  * Step-by-step for Omeka Users
    * Select the page you want the timeline on: a simple or an exhibit page. Go to the *Text* box, click *HTML Editor*.
    * Paste your Html code, and click ***OK***.
    * Check the ***Public*** box to allow the timeline page to be viewed publicly.
    * ***Save Changes*** to the page.
    * Your timeline is now on your Omeka site. You can view the public page that your Timeline is on to make sure you are satisfied with the appearance.
